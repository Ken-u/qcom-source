GENERAL DESCRIPTION
  Access control lists are used to define IP packet filters. These
  filters can be used e.g. for firewall functionality, address
  translation for selected ranges, or to build policy based routing
  rules.
  ACLs are defined as integer functions, which take information
  about the IP packet filtered as parameters. The return value
  is either '0' for a deny (packet drop) or the highest priority
  rule class for which a match was found.
  This file defines a common ACL function prototype as well as some
  macros to specify ACLs more similar to the usual language based
  syntax on routers and hosts.
  The following is an example of an ACL:

  ACL_DEF( inbound_filter )
  ACL_START
    DENY( ACL_DEFAULT_CLASS, DST_ADDR_IS_IN( IPV4( 127,0,0,1 ), 0xffffffff ) )
    DENY( ACL_DEFAULT_CLASS, SRC_ADDR_IS_IN( LOCALHOST, 0xffffffff ) )
    PASS( ACL_DEFAULT_CLASS, DST_ADDR_IS_IN( LOCALHOST, 0xffffffff ) )
  ACL_END

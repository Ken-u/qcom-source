  Definition of various ps_phys_link control operations. Please do NOT change
  the values of the existing enumerated types when adding new ones (to ensure
  that object code released with previous versions of the code do not break).
  Each of the following control operations have associated tyepdef (with
  corresponding names) that are passed in or returned for get/set operations.

  The most significant bit of the enum value MUST be set for all these
  IOCTLs. This is used as a distinguishing factor between ps_iface, ps_flow
  and phys_link releated IOCTLs.

  Note:
    GET operations are assigned even numbers
    SET operations are assigned odd numbers.

    Also ensure that symetric operations are grouped.

FUNCTION PS_PHYS_LINK_IOCTL()

DESCRIPTION
  This function performs various operations on the given phys link.
  Typically, these operations are to get or set a value.

DEPENDENCIES
  None.

PARAMETERS

  phys_link_ptr             - Phys link on which the specified operations
                              is to be performed

  ioctl_name                - The operation name

  argval_ptr                - Pointer to operation specific structure

  ps_errno                   - Error code returned in case of failure (Error
                               values are those defined in dserrno.h)

                              DS_EINVAL - Returned when the specified IOCTL
                              does not belong to the common set of IOCTLs
                              and there is no IOCTL mode handler registered
                              for the specified interface.

                              DS_EOPNOTSUPP - Returned by the lower level
                              IOCTL mode handler when specified IOCTL is not
                              supported by the interface. For instance, this
                              would be returned by interfaces that do not
                              support a certain "iface specific common IOCTL"
                              (i.e. these are common IOCTLs, but the
                              implementation is mode specific)

                              DS_EFAULT - This error code is returned if the
                              specified arguments for the IOCTL are correct
                              but an error is encountered while executing
                              the IOCTL.

                              DS_NOMEMORY - This error code is returned if we
                              run out of mempory buffers during execution.

RETURN VALUE
  0 - on success
  -1 - on failure

SIDE EFFECTS
  None.

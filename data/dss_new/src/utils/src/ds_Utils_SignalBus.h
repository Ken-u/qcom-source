  @file DSSignalBus.h

  This file provides the ds::Utils::SignalBus library. It is currently
  defined to be a wrapper around the ISignalBus interface.

  SignalBus()
    Constructor for the signal bus object.

  ~SignalBus()
    Destructor for the signal bus object.

  Add()
    Add a signal to the signal bus.

  Remove()
    Remove a signal object from the signal bus.

  Set()
    Set the SignalBus - all existing signals and future signals added
    to the bus will be set.

  Clear()
    Clear the SignalBus - future signals added to the bus will not be set.

  Strobe()
    Set all existing signals on the SignalBus. Future signals added
    to the bus will not be set.

  OnEnable()
    A signal passed to this function will be set if any signals
    in the SignalBus become enabled.

        @brief
        Adds a ISignal object to the signal bus.

        @details
        This method is used to add an ISignal object to the signal bus.
        Adding of ISignalCtl objects is not supported (CS does support
        this, but is not recommended).

        ds::Utils::SignalBus only allows addition of ds::Utils::Signal
        objects. CS signals/any other implementations are not supported.

        A signal cannot be added to a SignalBus in Detached state. That is,
        if the signal's ISignalCtl facet has detached the signal (permanantly
        disabled the signal), then adding to signal bus is not supported. In
        this condition, EINVAL error code is returned.

        A signal can be added to one SignalBus only. If the signal is tried
        to be added to more than 1 buses, then EINVAL is returned.

        @side_effects  The signal's internal state is changed, so it cannot
                       be added to any other signal buses.

        @params pISignal - Pointer to ISignal object to be added.
        @see    AEEISignalBus.h::ISignalBus_Add()
        @return SUCCESS - On successful addition
                EFAULT  - If invalid/unsupported signal is tried to be added.

                EINVAL  - If signal has been detached.

           be set depending upon whether they are enabled.

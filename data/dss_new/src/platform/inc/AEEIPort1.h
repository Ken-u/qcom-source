  INTERFACES DOCUMENTATION
=======================================================================

IPort1 Interface

Description:

   Generic interface for bidirectional data stream providing
   Read/Readable, Write/Writeable, Control, and Close operations.

   Instances of IPort1 usually come from a factory or some other 
   interface that owns or provides access to the data to be read or written.

   For example, if there is an IPort1-based implementation of file,
   you may get an instances of the file from the filesystem when the 
   file is opened.  Similarly, given an IPort1-based serial I/O
   implementation, an instance could be created to access serial I/O.
 
Interface ID: 
   AEEIID_IPort1
 
=======================================================================

IPort1_AddRef()

Description:
    This function is inherited from IQI_AddRef().
 
Prototype:
   unsigned int IPort1_AddRef(IPort1* _pif)
 
Parameters:
   _pif      : Pointer to the IPort1 interface
 
Return Value: 
   Updated reference count 

See Also:
    IPort1_Release()

=======================================================================

IPort1_Release()

Description:
    This function is inherited from IQI_Release()..

Prototype:
   unsigned int IPort1_Release(IPort1* _pif)
 
Parameters:
   _pif      : Pointer to the IPort1 interface
 
Return Value:
   updated reference count
 
See Also:
    IPort1_AddRef()

=======================================================================

IPort1_QueryInterface()

Prototype:
    int IPort1_QueryInterface(IPort1* _pif, AEEIID iid, void** ppo)
 
Parameters:
   _pif      : Pointer to the IPort1 interface
   iid       : Interface ID
   ppo       : interface pointer
 
Return Value:
   Returns AEE_SUCCESS if the operation was successful, otherwise an 
   appropriate error code.
 
Comments:
   Common error codes:
     AEE_ECLASSNOTSUPPORT: The interface type is not supported
 
Description:
    This function is inherited from IQI_QueryInterface().

=======================================================================

IPort1_Read()

Description:
   Copy bytes from the source stream to the specified buffer.  All copied
   bytes are "consumed" (i.e. the "read pointer" is advanced).

Prototype:
   int IPort1_Read
   (
      IPort1 *pif,
      byte *pBuf,
      int nBufSize,
      int *pnRead
   )

Parameters:
   pif     : [in]  : Pointer IPort1 interface
   pBuf    : [out] : pointer to buffer to receive bytes read
   nBufSize: [in]  : size of pBuf buffer
   pnRead  : [out] : the number of bytes read successfully

Return Value:

   AEE_SUCCESS      : if *pnRead = 0 and nBufSize != 0, end of read stream.
                      If not, *pnRead indicates the amount of data read.
   AEE_EWOULDBLOCK  : no data available at the moment call Readable() to wait
   AEE_ENOTALLOWED  : Does not have the capabilities to perform the operation.

   Another appropriate error code if operation was not successful

Comments:
   Note that the AEE_EWOULDBLOCK return value is used so that the Readable
   can be called. pnRead > 0 indicates that data has been successfully read
   from the port.

   As already indicated above, when the end is reached for reading from
   an IPort1, *pnRead returned is 0 (for nBufSize > 0) and error code 
   returned is AEE_SUCCESS.

Side Effects:
   None

See Also:
   IPort1_Readable()

=======================================================================

IPort1_Readable()

Description:
   Register a signal to be set when IPort1_Read() would
   return something other than AEE_EWOULDBLOCK.

Prototype:
   int IPort1_Readable
   (
      IPort1 *pif,
      ISignal *piSignal
   )

Parameters:
   pif      :  [in] : Pointer IPort1 interface
   piSignal :  [in] : Pointer to a signal to be set when the port
                      may be read with IPort1_Read().

Return Value:
   AEE_SUCCESS  : Successfully registered the signal.

   Another appropriate error code if operation was not successful.

Comments:
   The signal pointed by the piSignal must be created before calling 
   this function.

Side Effects:
   None

See Also:
   IPort1_Read()


===========================================================================

IPort1_Write()

Description:
   Copy bytes from the specified buffer to the source stream.  All copied
   bytes are "consumed" (i.e. the "write pointer" is advanced).

Prototype:
   int IPort1_Write
   (
      IPort1 *pif,
      const byte *pBuf,
      int nBufSize,
      int *pnWritten
   )

Parameters:
   pif      : [in]  : pointer to the IPort1 interface
   pBuf     : [in]  : pointer to buffer from which bytes are taken to write
                      to the port
   nBufSize : [in]  : size of data in pBuf
   pnWritten: [out] : size of data written to the Port

Return Value:

   AEE_SUCCESS      : Successfully wrote pnWritten bytes to the port
   AEE_ENOTALLOWED  : Does not have the capabilities to perform the operation.
   AEE_EWOULDBLOCK  : no data available at the moment call Writeable() to wait

   Another appropriate error code if operation was not successful

Comments:
   Note that the AEE_EWOULDBLOCK return value is used so that the writeable
   can be called. pnWritten > 0 indicates that data has been successfully
   written to the port.

Side Effects:
   None

See Also:
   IPort1_Writeable()

=======================================================================

IPort1_Writeable()

Description:
   Register a signal to be set when IPort1_Write() would
   return something other than AEE_EWOULDBLOCK.

Prototype:
   void IPort1_Writeable
   (
      IPort1 *pif,
      ISignal *piSignal
   )

Parameters:
   pif      : [in] : Pointer IPort1 interface
   piSignal : [in] : Pointer to a signal that is associated with a
                     callback function that can be invoked when the port
                     may be written with IPort1_Write().

Return Value:
   AEE_SUCCESS  : Successfully registered the signal.
   Another appropriate error code if operation was not successful.

Comments:
   The signal pointed by the piSignal must be created before calling 
   this function.

Side Effects:
   None

See Also:
   IPort1_Write()

=======================================================================

IPort1_Control()

Description:
   This function allows some control over the behavior of an IPort1,
   e.g. setting/getting configuration.

   Its form is analogous to SYSV's Control, with encoded arguments that
   should be specified with the *_Control_* macros listed here.  Its
   intended use is for special, out-of-interface-signature behavior.  For
   that reason, it is super-generic.

   This method could also be used to selectively close the capabilities
   of the port.

Prototype:
   int IPort1_Control
   (
     IPort1 *pif,
     AEEUID  uidControl,
     const byte *pIn, 
     int nInLen,
     byte *pOut, 
     int nOutLen, 
     int* pnOutLenReq
   )


Parameters:
   pif        : [in]  : pointer to the IPort interface
   uidControl : [in]  : uid of the control operation, defined by the class
                        implementing IPort1
   pIn        : [in]  : input buffer argument for the operation
   nInLen     : [in]  : length of pIn
   pOut       : [out] : output buffer argument for the operation, filled
                        up to nOutLen bytes of the result of the operation,
                        if any.
   nOutLen    : [in]  : length of pOut
   pnOutLen   : [out] : set to length of pOut required to complete 
                        the operation

Return Value :
  AEE_SUCCESS  : Successfully completed the control.

  Another appropriate error code if operation was not successful.

Comments:

  Data passed in the buffer arguments must always be arranged as 
  if they've already been marshalled, i.e. the precise byte ordering must
  be specified.  The data must not include pointers or interfaces. 


Side Effects:
   None

See Also:
   None

=======================================================================

IPort1_Close()

Description:
   This function closes the port.  Any further Read() and Write() on 
   the port will fail, and the IPort1 will become readable and writeable.

Prototype:
   int IPort1_Close
   (
      IPort1 *pif
   )

Parameters:
   pif: [in] : Pointer to the IPort interface

Return Value:

  AEE_SUCCESS      : Successfully closed the port

  Another appropriate error code if operation was not successful.

Comments:

Side Effects:
   None

See Also:
   None

  @brief
  This file defines the class that implements the IEventManager interface.

  @details
  This file exports the network handle object, from which all network
  related objects like Network, Qos, Mcast etc., derive.

  The Handle exports the concept of handle (or identifier) for any
  network objects. Instances of the Handle may not be directly created.
  Only instances of derived classes like Network, Qos, Mcast etc.,
  can be created.

  The Handle class also exports Event registration and reporting mechanism.
  The applications wishing to receive event notification from a certain
  interface call RegEvent() method of that interface (that interface should
  derive from IHandle). The signal registered is set when the event is
  triggered.

  @class ds::Net::Handle

  @brief
  This class provides the implementation of the IEventManager interface.

  @details
  The Handle class acts as a base class for many of the network objects.
  The primary purpose of the handle class is to provide mechanism for
  event registration and signalling. The IEventManager interface exports
  the following methods:
  1. RegEvent() : Allow registration of a certain event with a given
     ISignal object. There is no function for de-registration. To dereg
     a signal, Release() should be called on the signal object itself.

  Apart from the methods of IEventManager interface, Handle class also
  supports couple of protected methods. These methods are only available
  to internal DSNET objects and are not exported via IEventManager
  interface:
  1. Notify(): This function is to notify the client when an event occurs.
     The client is notified via the signal registered for the given event.
  2. SetHandle(): This method sets the handle in the object. The Handle
     is usually set during creation of the object. The handle can also be
     set when the underlying network handle becomes invalid for the object.
  3. GetHandle(): This method returns the underlying handle identifier for
     the object. If this is a Network object, then this handle would refer
     to the PS iface pointer. If the handle is QoS object, then this handle
     would represent the PS flow pointer associated with the network.

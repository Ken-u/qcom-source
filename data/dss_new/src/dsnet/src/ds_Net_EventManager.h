  @brief
  This file provides the class ds::Net::EventManager which is used for 
  processing and propagating of the network events.

  @detail
  The ds::Net::EventManager is a singleton object. It is initialized during
  after-task-start initialization to register for all iface/flow/phys link
  events. The EventManager singleton maintains a set of lists for each 
  different "event groups" in the system. Each list is a set of active objects
  corresponding to the event group. For example, all the network objects
  are put in a networkObjList, the QoS objects are put in qosObjList etc.

  @section Event Framework

  @subsection Objectives
  The event framework is designed with the following objectives:
  1. Addition of new events should be straightforward.
  2. Event framework is not dependent upon the events themselves (generic 
     framework). No special logic needs to be used to handle and propogate 
     individual events. It should be straightforward to add new events
     to the framework.

  @subsection Event Registration
  The EventManager singleton allows the objects to register for events 
  from the underlying layers. There is no explicit registration involved. 
  Registrations happen automatically, when the objects are created. For 
  example, when the network object is created, it is added to the 
  EventManager::networkObjList, and would start receiving network events 
  immediately. 

  @subsection Event Propogation
  The following illustration how the event is propogated to the objects. We
  will start from the event indication from the PS iface layer and will 
  trace it all the way to the application.

                        V             V            |              V  
                    Continue      Continue         V          Continue

                                              | Notify() |
                                              +----------+

  In the above illustration, the iface handle on which the event occurred
  matches with the net3's object handle. Hence Notify() would be called on
  net3. However, net3 may not be interested in the event that has occurred
  right now. net3 only processes the event if app has registered for it.

  The Handle object maintains the event registrations performed by the 
  application in the form of EventNode objects. When Handle::Notify() is 
  called, the EventNode objects for the Handle are traversed. If the current 
  event matches that of a event node, the corresponding signal is set.

  +------------+      ev != ev1,        ev == ev2         ev != ev3,
                      return                |             return
                                            |
                                            V
                                      +-------------+
                                      | sig2->Set() |
                                      +-------------+

  @todo
  Cleanup event management logic. Currently it is going through network 
  factory, then through network objects etc. A lot of event dependent 
  infomration is being maintained. Make sure everyone uses userHandle if 
  required. Check to see where psEventInfo is getting used and we should
  get rid of that.

  @brief      
  This method processes the events occurring from the PS iface layer.

  @details
  This method processes the events from the PS iface layer. The EventManager
  registers with the Network platform for all events from all ifaces, flows 
  and phys links during initialization using this method as callback. Since
  this method is registered as a callback with PS iface layer, it has
  to be a static method.

  Depending upon the current event, this method goes through the relevent 
  list of objects waiting on the event and informs the same to them. It 
  performs a tranlsation from the PS iface event names to DS Net event names
  and calls traverse on the appropriate event group.

  @note
  This method is called as a callback function from the PS iface layer. Hence
  there is a great possibility that this callback is tasklocked etc. Keep
  the amount of processing to minimum levels in this function.

  @param[in]  handle - iface handle on which the event occurred.
  @param[in]  eventName - Name of the event in PS iface format.
  @param[in]  pEventInfo - Event info union associated with the event.

  This function initializes the event manager instance.

  This function initializes the event manager instance. It registers 
  callback functions for iface, flow and phys link events for all handles

  This function is a static method that is called only once during 
  after-task-start initialization.

  The initialization performed in this function assumes that the PS iface
  layers have already been initialized.

  This framework needs some design changes to perform initializations on
  3rd party OS platforms.

  @brief      
  Returns the singleton instance of the event manager.

  @details
  This is an inline function that returns the singleton instance of the 
  event manager. Since this function is called a lot of times, possibly 
  during data path as well, it has been defined as inline.
  
  In order to keep the processing to minimal levels in this function, it
  does not perform any additional error checks etc. It simply returns
  the instance singleton variable stored.
  
  If instance is called before EventManager is initialized, it could result
  in a NULL value being returned. However, since EventManager is 
  initialized during powerup, this is an acceptable risk.

  @dependencies
  PS Iface layer should be initialized before calling this.
  ds::Net::EventManager::Init() must have been called.

  @param      None.
